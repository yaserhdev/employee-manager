# employee-manager
Week 12 Challenge

In this challenge, I was given the task of creating CLI application which serves as a database to manage employees within an organization. The application contains the following features:

- database which holds records of departments, roles, and employees

    1. Departments contains department names
    2. Roles contains role names, salaries, and departments
    3. Employees contains an employees first name, last name, role, department, salary, and manager

- view all data in table format

- add departments, roles, or employees to the database

- update an employees current cole

- contains an easy to navigate list:

    1. View all departments
    2. View all roles
    3. View all employees
    4. Add a department
    5. Add a role
    6. Add an employee
    7. Update an employee role
    8. Quit


## Installation
To install this application you will need Node.js and MySQL installed on your computer. Once installed download the files from the repository and navigate to /employee-manager in your terminal. Use the following commands to install the required dependencies:
```
npm install inquirer@8.2.4
npm i
```
Once dependencies have been installed you will need to set up and seed the database. To do so navigate to /employee-manager/db in your terminal, start MySQL, and use the following commands:
```
SOURCE schema.sql;
SOURCE seeds.sql;
quit;
```
Once the database has been set up and seeded, navigate back to /employee-manager in your terminal and use the following command to start the application:
```
node index.js
```
